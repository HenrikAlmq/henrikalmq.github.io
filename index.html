        <div id="content1">I'm 29 years old and live by myself in Jönköping, Sweden. I just started studying to become a web developer, which is a challenge and something I'm really excited about. On my sparetime I like to play golf with my father and friends, 
            play videogames in particular World of Warcraft and Counter Strike GO, I love a big steak on a resturant with either my family or friends and lately learning new skills.</div>

        <div id="content2">When I graduated from high school I had no clue what to do so I started working within the warehouse industry. My first job was at Aditro Logistics between 2011 and 2018. I tried various position, all from forklift driver to business support.
             I recieved an offer from a new 3PL company Reach Logistics were I would be their process developer manager, this is where I found my intrest within programming. Late 2019 Reach logistics got bought by Dream Logistics and I started working on Dreams IT department 
             with internal and external support. Since Dream develop almost all their systems inhouse, I took a few online courses in SQL and C#.
